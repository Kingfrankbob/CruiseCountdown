# CruiseCountdown
Repo containing code to the binary countdown I made until our cruise

Uses the light strip but basically bent in half<br>
So it sets each half to be the reverse so it looks the same from both angles, im sure I could have done this differently but whatever
<br>
<br>
<strong>!!REMEBER THIS IS BINARY!!</strong><br>
So you have to calculate accordingly...
